## 6. Report the result to the user

Write the report to the user from the checklist and the report, in the user's language, in the shape below. Take every number from the JSON; do not count from memory.

#### First — record template proposals

**This is a judgment call for you.** In katachi a `.template { }` can be attached to any file declaration in `layout { }`, and `:architecture-test:katachiTemplate` generates it **exactly where that declaration says it goes**. As "what you can do next" after installation, propose which Roles to give a template, and what it would contain.

Work from `roles` in the step 1 report. **The good candidates are Roles with many files of the same shape** (UseCase, ViewModel, Screen, Repository, and so on). Do not propose one for a Role with a small `count`, or one whose files each take a different shape.

**Roles whose destination directory is a wildcard, like `feature/*/...`, are candidates too** (ViewModel and Screen are usually shaped this way). Name that `*` with `capture("feature")` and you can pick the destination with `--arg feature=home` (step 2 of 6-D). **Every `*` left in the destination needs a name, both the module directory's and the package directory's.** If the two get the same value, give both one name (write `capture("feature")` in two places). The only thing that can't be named is `**` (a partial match can be named with `capture()`); don't propose one for a Role whose destination is only that.

For each Role, decide the following and add it to the report's `templates`.

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| `role` | The Role's name (as written in `architecture { }`) |
| `files` | The files it creates. An array. Write them with the parameter embedded, like `${name}UseCase.kt` (only when one kind of file has several name shapes; files of different kinds, like an interface and its implementation, get separate Roles and one entry each) |
| `params` | The parameter names taken with `stringParameter()` or another `*Parameter()`, plus the name given to a wildcard in the destination (for example, `feature`). An array. **List as many as the names you gave to the `*` in the destination** (one, if you gave the module directory and the package directory the same name) |
| `basedOn` | The existing file the skeleton is based on (one of `roles[].examples`) |
| `reason` | Why this Role gets one (the count, and that the files share a shape) |

```json
"templates": [
  { "role": "UseCase", "files": ["${name}UseCase.kt"], "params": ["name"], "basedOn": "domain/src/main/kotlin/com/example/app/domain/useCase/GetUserUseCase.kt", "reason": "All 18 are interfaces and share one shape" },
  { "role": "UseCaseImplementation", "files": ["${name}UseCaseImpl.kt"], "params": ["name"], "basedOn": "data/src/main/kotlin/com/example/app/data/useCase/GetUserUseCaseImpl.kt", "reason": "All 18 implement a UseCase and share one shape" },
  { "role": "ViewModel", "files": ["${name}ViewModel.kt"], "params": ["feature", "name"], "basedOn": "feature/home/src/main/kotlin/com/example/app/feature/home/HomeViewModel.kt", "reason": "12 are one each in every feature/* module, and share one shape. The * in feature/* and the * of the package directory take the same name, so one name, feature, picks the destination" }
]
```

If you judge that no Role suits a template, record nothing. What you record goes into the "Next action" of your report below, and the report page shows it under "Template proposals". **Do not write `.template { }` here.** That happens in 6-D, after the user agrees.

#### The report

**If an item of steps 0 to 5 is not done**, say so and stop there:

```
❌ Could not set up katachi

Unfinished items:
- <id> <label>            (every item that is not done)

Resume:
  Working directory: file://<workdir>
  Done: <the ids that are done>
  Next section: <the section of the first item not done, from the table in references/setup/README.md>
  Definition: file://<project root>/<meta.moduleDir>/src/test/kotlin (or "not yet" before scaffold)
  Questions: report answered <n> / unanswered <n>, checklist answered <n> / unanswered <n>

Check list:
file://<workdir>/check-list.html
```

**Otherwise**, report what was done. Start with ⚠️ when the checklist's `violations` is not empty, ✅ when it is:

```
✅ Set up katachi

**The generated code needs your review.** Please check what it contains.

- Check list: file://<workdir>/check-list.html
- Codebase report: file://<workdir>/project-code-base-report.html
- `:architecture-test:test` result: ✅ All green  (or: ⚠️ architecture violations left: <number of violations>)
- Questions for you (check list): answered <n> / unanswered <n>
    - <id> <question> → recommended: <recommendation>        (each unanswered one)
- Inconsistencies in the codebase (report): answered <n> / unanswered <n>
    - <id> <question> → recommended: <recommendation>
- Changed files: <number of changedFiles>
- Next action:
    - **Review** ProjectArchitecture.kt under file://<project root>/<meta.moduleDir>/
    - Run one real implementation task and confirm that the definition works            (6-A, unless 6-1 is done)
    - Add `:architecture-test:test` to CI                                                (6-B, unless 6-2 is done)
    - You can set up documentation generation (`./gradlew :architecture-test:katachiDocs`) (6-C, unless 6-3 is done)
    - You can set up code generation from templates. Suggestions: <n>
        - <role>: <files> (parameters: <params>)                                         (6-D, only when templates is not empty)

Resume:
  Working directory: file://<workdir>
  Done: <the ids that are done>
  Next section (pick the one the user asked for):
    - Fix what the review pointed out: 6-0
    - <each of 6-A to 6-D not done yet, with its title>
```

Leave out a "Questions" line when that file has no questions. Mention the steps that carry a `warning` under the result line.

**For the unanswered questions, ask the user to answer them**: show the URL of the report for ids starting with `cq` and of the checklist for ids starting with `q`, and have them answered in the browser ("Export answers"), or in chat. Write what comes back into `answers` (0-3, "Answers").

> **The session may end here.** The next session finds the working directory (the directory with `check-list.html` below the project root), reads the checklist's JSON, and goes on from there: from the first item that is not done, or, once step 5 is done, from what the user asks for (6-0, or one of 6-A to 6-D). The sections are in the table in `references/setup/README.md`. The previous session's results are in the checklist and the report; if `tmp/katachi-command.txt` is there, run katachi the way it says (0-1). Do not rely on the conversation's memory.
